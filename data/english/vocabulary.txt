no one knows for surra how old IT is the development of farming gave rise to the neolithic revolution as people gave up nomadic hunting and became settlers in cities agriculture and domestication probably started in the fertile crescent the nile valley the levant and Mesopotamia the area called fertile crescent is now in the countries of iraq syria turkey Jordan lebanon Israel and egypt wheat and barley are some of the first crops people grew people probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops but still gathered many foods from the wild people may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change farming can feed many More people than huntergatherers can feed olla the same amount of land this allowed the human population to grow to such large numbers as there are today types arable farming arable farming means growing crops this would include wheat or vegetables growing fruit means having orchards devoted to fruit they cannot be switched easily with growing field crops therefore they are not classed as arable land in the statistics agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals but also growing other things like flowers and nursery plants manure or dung animal hides skins or furs leather animals fungi fibers cotton wool hemp and flax biofuel and drugs biopharmaceuticals marijuana opium many people still live by subsistence agriculture olla a small farm they can only grow enough food to feed the farmer his family and his animals the yield is the amount of food grown olla a given amount of land and IT is often low this is because subsistence farmers are generally less educated and they have less money to buy equipment drought and other problems sometimes cause famines where yields are low deforestation can provide new land to grow More food this provides More nutrition for the farmers family but can be bad for the country and the surrounding environment over many years in some countries farms are often fewer and larger during the th century they have become More productive because farmers are able to grow better varieties of plants use More fertilizer use More water and More easily control weeds and pests many farms also use machines so fewer people can farm More land there are fewer farmers in rich countries but the farmers are able to grow More this kind of intensive agriculture comes with its own set of problems farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers pesticides chemicals that kill bugs and herbicides chemicals that kill weeds these chemicals can pollute the soil or the water they can also create bugs and weeds that are More resistant to the chemicals causing outbreaks of these pests the soil can be damaged by erosion blowing or washing away salt buildup or loss of structure irrigation adding water from rivers can pollute water and lower the water table these problems have all got solutions and modern young farmers usually have a good technical education farmers select plants with better yield taste and nutritional value they also choose plants that can survive plant disease and drought and are easier to harvest centuries of artificial selection and breeding have changed crop plants the crops produce better yield fertilizers chemical pest control and irrigation all help some plants are improved with genetic engineering one example is modifying the plant to resist herbicides food IT is important for there to be enough food for everyone the food must also be safe and good people say IT is not always safe because IT contains some chemicals other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment for this reason there are several types of agriculture traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries intensive agriculture is mostly done in countries with More money IT uses pesticides machinery chemical fertilizers organic farming is using only natural products such as compost and Green manure integrated farming is using local resources and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process agricultural policy focuses olla the goals and methods of agricultural production common goals of policy include the quality amount and safety of food problems there are some serious problems that people face trying to grow food today these include pollution erosion diseases pests weeds drought rainfall climate contamination crops the Major crops produced in the world in are maize corn wheat rice and cotton maize million metric tons wheat million metric tons rice million metric tons cotton million metric

other operations such as exponentiation and extraction of roots are also studied in arithmetic other arithmetic topics includes working with signed numbers fractions decimals and percentages most people learn arithmetic in primary school but some people do not learn arithmetic and others forget the arithmetic they learned many jobs require a knowledge of arithmetic and many employers complain that IT is hard to find people WHO know enough arithmetic a few of the many jobs that require arithmetic include carpenters plumbers auto mechanics accountants architects doctors and nurses arithmetic is needed in all areas of mathematics science and engineering some arithmetic can be carried out mentally a calculator can also be used to perform arithmetic computers can do IT More quickly which is one reason global positioning system receivers have a small computer inside examples of arithmetic adding is commutative is the same as subtracting is not commutative is different from multiplying is commutative is the same as dividing is not commutative is different from related pages affine arithmetic elementary algebra interval arithmetic modular arithmetic references arithmetics in mathematics addition represented by the symbol is an operation which combines two mathematical objects together into another mathematical object of the same type called the sum addition can occur with simple objects such as numbers and More complex objects such as vectors and matrices arithmetic in arithmetic addition is finding the total of two or More numbers the sign for addition is and the name for the sign is plus another name for the total is the sum counting examples for example there are objects in two groups the objects are small circles o one group has five of these objects the other group has three of these objects to find the total number of objects in both groups the objects can be counted another way to find the number of objects in both groups is to ADD the numbers in each group adding another method is to ADD the numbers of objects in group a and group b since they are already counted in symbols there are rules for adding numbers that people learn there are also rules for adding numbers that are built into machines binary adder the rule says that in another counting example sally and Bill have children sally and Bill get More children sally and Bill have added three children to their two children and now have five children vertical addition the animation above demonstrates the addition of seven hundred and eighty six and four hundred and sixty seven the problems digits have been separated into units tens and hundreds place value first the units and are added together to make so ten and units with the written below and the ten carried to the tens column next in the tens column the and are added together to make tens so hundred and tens with the written below and the hundred carried to the hundreds column finally in the hundreds column and are added together to make hundreds so thousand and hundreds with the written below and the thousand carried to the thousand column the final answer is thus one thousand two hundred and fifty three a measurement example Tom wants to know the distance between his house and sallys house bobs house is meters east of toms house sallys house is meters east of bobs house toms house meters bobs house meters sallys house the distance from toms house to sallys house can be found by adding the distances already measured the distance from toms house to bobs house added to the distance from bobs house to sallys house is the same as the distance from toms house to sallys house that is three hundred meters plus meters hence sallys house is meters to the east of toms house properties commutativity addition is commutative meaning that one can change the order of the numbers in a sum but still get the same result for example associativity addition is also associative which means that when three or More numbers are added together the order of operations does not change the result for any three numbers a b and c IT is true that for example and which means that addition as increase addition can also mean to make bigger example of addition as increase for example Tom has a house Tom puts a new room olla the house this new room is called an addition John is making food to make the food taste better John puts salt in the food that is John adds salt to the food the salt is a food additive or addition to the food addition table related pages identity element order of operations references

called oceania million people live in Australia and about of them live near the east coast the country is divided up into six states and two territories and More than half of australias population lives in and around the cities of Sydney Melbourne brisbane Perth Canberra and adelaide the first people to live in the country were indigenous australians but most of them died from smallpox during colonization Australia is known for its mining coal Iro gold diamonds and crystals its production of wool and as the worlds largest producer of bauxite its emblem is a flower called the golden wattle Australia is also known for its animals and rich wildlife a kangaroo is the national symbol of Australia geography australias landmass of square kilometers is olla the indoaustralian plate the continent of Australia including the Island of Tasmania was separated from the other continents of the world many millions of years ago because of this many animals and plants live in Australia that do not live anywhere Else these include animals like the kangaroo the koala the EMU the kookaburra and the platypus people first arrived in Australia More than years ago these native australians are called the Australia aborigines for the history of Australia see history of Australia most of the Australia colonies having been settled from Brita became mostly independent democratic states in the s and all six combined as a federation olla january the first prime minister of Australia was edmund barton in Australia is a member of the united nations and the commonwealth of nations IT is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy with Elizabeth ii as queen of Australia and head of state and a governorgeneral WHO is chosen by the prime minister to carry out all the duties of the queen in Australia regions and cities Australia has six states two Major mainland territories and other minor territories the states are new south Wales queensland south Australia Tasmania Victor and western Australia the two Major mainland territories are the northern territory and the Australia capital territory act in according to world bank Australia had just over million people most australians live in cities along the coast such as Sydney Melbourne brisbane Perth Darwin hobart and adelaide the largest inland city is Canberra which is also the nations capital the largest city is Sydney Australia is a very big country but much of the land is very dry and the middle of the continent is mostly desert only the areas around the east west and south coast have enough rain and a suitable climate not too hot for many farms and cities history aboriginal people the Australia aboriginal people arrived in Australia about years ago or even earlier until the arrival of british settlers in the aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land they lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways an example of aboriginal land management was the cumberland plain where Sydney is now every few years the aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees this meant that a lot of grass grew back but not many big trees kangaroos like to live olla grassy plains but not in forests the kangaroos that lived olla the plain were a good food supply for the aboriginal people sometimes aborigines would name a perso after an animal and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population aboriginal people did not usually build houses except huts of grass leaves and bark they did not usually build walls or fences and there were no horses cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens the only aboriginal buildings that are known are fishtraps made from stones piled up in the river and the remains of a few stone huts in Victor and Tasmania the aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth in some parts of Australia the people used sharp flakedstone spearheads but most aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making the boomerang was used in some areas for sport and for hunting the aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them they believed that they had grown from the land so IT was like their mother and they belonged to the land terra australis in the s dutch merchants traded with the islands of batavia now Indonesia to the north of Australia and several different dutch ships touched olla the coast of Australia the dutch governor van diemen sent Abel tasman olla a voyage of discovery and he found Tasmania which he named van diemens land its name was later changed to honour the man WHO discovered IT the british government was surra that there must be a very large land in the south that had not been explored they sent captain James cook to the pacific ocean his ship hms endeavour carried the famous scientists sir Joseph banks and dr solander WHO were going to Tahiti where they would watch the planet Venus pass in front of the sun captain cooks secret missio was to find terra australis the land of the south the voyage of discovery was very successful because they found new zealand and sailed right around IT then they sailed westward at last a boy William hicks WHO was up the mast spotted land olla the horizon captain cook named that bit of land point hicks they sailed up the coast and captain cook named the land that he saw new south Wales at last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food Joseph banks and dr solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were they collected hundreds of plants to take back to england captain cook saw the aboriginal people with their simple way of life he saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit but there were no houses and no fences in most parts of the world people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land but the aboriginal people did not own the land in that way they belonged to the land like a baby belongs to its mother captain cook went home to england and told the government that noone owned the land this would later cause a terrible problem for the aboriginal people settlement in the s in england laws were tough many people were poor and gaols jails were full a perso could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread many people were hanged for small crimes but usually they were just thrown in gaol often they were sent away to the british colonies in america but by the s the colonies in america became the united states they were free from british rule and would not take englands convicts any More so england needed to find a new and less populated place by the s the gaols of england were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships the government decided to make a settlement in new south Wales and send some of the convicts there in the first fleet of eleven ships set sail from portsmouth carrying convicts sailors marines a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years their leader was captain Arthur phillip they were to make a new colony at the place that captain cook had discovered named botany bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists captain phillip found that botany bay was flat and windy there was not much fresh water he went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbor which he said was the finest harbor in the world there were many small bays olla the harbor so he decided olla one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat Shore to land olla olla january the flag was raised and new south Wales was claimed in the name of King George iii of england and the new settlement was called Sydney for the first few years of the settlement things were very difficult noone in the british government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony nobody had chosen them carefully there was only one man WHO was a farmer there was noone among the convicts WHO was a builder a brickmaker or a blacksmith noone knew how to fix the tools when they broke all of the cattle escaped there were no cooking pots all the plants were different so noone knew which ones could be eaten IT was probable that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation somehow the little group of tents with a hut for the governor Arthur phillip and another hut for the supply of food grew into a small town with streets a bridge over the stream a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships by the s there was a fine brick house for the governor there was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today settlements had spread out from Sydney firstly to norfolk Island and to van diemens land Tasmania and also up the coast to newcastle where coal was discovered and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd spanish merino sheep had been brought to Sydney and by farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of england while the settlement was growing in new south Wales IT was also growing in Tasmania the climate in Tasmania was More like that in england and farmers found IT easy to grow crops there exploration because Australia is such a very large land IT was easy to think that IT might be able to hold a very large number of people in the early days of the colony a great number of explorers went out searching for good land to settle olla when the settlers looked west from Sydney they saw a range of mountains which they called the blue mountains they were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years noone could find their way through them in gregory blaxland William lawson and a yearold called William Charles wentworth crossed the blue mountains and found land olla the other side which was good for farming a road was built and the governor lachlan macquarie founded the town of bathurst olla the other side miles from Sydney some people like captain Charles sturt were surra that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find IT many of the explorers did not prepare very well or Else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year some died like burke and wills Ludwig leichhardt got Lost twice the second time he was never seen again Major Thomas mitchell was one of the most successful explorers he mapped the country as he went and his maps remained in use for More than years he travelled all the way to what is now western Victor and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white perso there the henty brothers had come from Tasmania had built themselves a house had a successful farm and fed the Major and his men olla roast lamb and wine self government the gold rushes of new south Wales and Victor started in leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold the population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry by the gold rushes had made some poor people very rich the transportation of convicts to Australia ended in the s and s and More changes came the people in Australia wanted to run their own country and not be told what to do from London the first governments in the colonies were run by governors chosen by London soon the settlers wanted local government and More democracy William wentworth started the Australia patriotic association australias first political party in to demand democratic government in the city councils started and some people could vote new south Wales legislative council had its first elections in again with some limits olla WHO could vote in limited selfgovernment was given by London to new south Wales Victor south Australia and Tasmania in the right to vote was given to all men over in south Australia the other colonies soon followed women were given the vote in the parliament of south Australia in and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections australians had started parliamentary democracies all across the continent but voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament the commonwealth of Australia until Australia was not a nation IT was six separate colonies governed by Brita they voted to juoda together to form one new country called the commonwealth of Australia in Australia was still part of the british empire and at first wanted only british or europeans to come to Australia but soon IT had its own money and its own army and navy in Australia at this time the trade unions were very strong and they started a political party the Australia labor party Australia passed many laws to help the workers in the first world war started in europe Australia joined in olla the side of Brita against germany austriahungary and the ottoman empire Australia soldiers were sent to Gallipoli in the ottoman empire they fought bravely but were beaten by the turks today Australia remembers this battle every year olla anzac day they also fought olla the western front More than australians

captured in the fall of Singapore by japan then japan started attacking Australia and people worried about invasion but with help from the united states navy the japanese were stopped after the war Australia became a close friend of the united states when the war ended Australia felt that IT needed many More people to fill the country up and to work so the government said IT would take in people from europe WHO had Lost their homes in the war IT did things like building the snowy mountains scheme over the next years millions of people came to Australia they came especially from italy and greece other countries in europe later they also came from countries like turkey and lebanon an important new party the liberal party of Australia was made by Robert menzies in and IT won lots of elections from until in then gough whitlam won for the labor party whitlam made changes but he made the senate unhappy and the governorgeneral sacked him and forced an election in then malcolm fraser won a few elections for the liberal party in the s many people began coming to Australia from china Vietnam malaysia and other countries in asia Australia became More multicultural in the s and s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world helped by mining and wool Australia started trading More with america than japan Australia supported the united states in wars against dictatorships in korea and Vietnam and later iraq Australia soldiers also helped the united nations in countries like east Timor in in the famous Sydney opera house opened in the s s and s lots of Australia movies actors and singers became famous around the world in the year Sydney had the summer olympics in the s and s the labor party under bob hawke and Paul keating then the liberal party

rich peaceful and democratic country but IT still has problems around of australians could not get a Job in a lot of land in Australia like uluru has been returned to aboriginal people but lots of aborigines are still poorer than everybody Else every year the government chooses a big number of new people from all around the world to come as immigrants to live in Australia these people may come

of artwork and was attempted by Leonardo da vinci in literature angels are generally held to be holy and virtuous hence the term is used loosely to apply to anyone particularly good or kind or having a good influence in his novel far from the madding crowd Thomas hardy chooses the name of an angel Gabriel for his kind and helpful hero olla the other hand in his play measure for measure shakespeares use of the name angelo is ironic since angelo is a character WHO likes to see himself as virtuous but WHO is concealing evil aspects of his nature fallen angels WHO are no longer holy or virtuous are also known as devils however since angels are held to be spirits that is nonmaterial beings medieval theologians were faced with the problem of how humans could see a nonphysical creature eventually a theory was put forward that angels must make themselves a body out of the nearest thing to the nonphysical ie from air hence in his famous poem aire and angels the seventeenth century metaphysical Poe John donne uses this idea to write a cynical comment olla women whose love he says is like an angels body of air while mens love is like the real thing the angel itself idea of guardian angel from the era of the romantics onwards there has developed the widely held belief that everyone has an angel assigned to guard them this concept is probably based olla jesus comment in matthew regarding children though IT is not mentioned elsewhere in the bible in superstitions seeing repetitive numbers are thought to be associated with numerology also referred to as angel numbers IT is believed that angels communicate with humans through repetitive appearances of numbers humanity has studied and used numbers since the dawn of time and no matter what the culture is there are certain numbers that hold specific value or meaning over other numbers references other websites ad hominem is a Lati word for a type of argument IT is a word often used in rhetoric rhetoric is the science of speaking well and convincing other people of your ideas translated to english ad hominem means against the perso in other words when someone makes an ad hominem they are attacking the perso they are arguing against instead of what they are saying the term comes from the Lati word homo which means human hominem is a gender neutral versio of the word homo in ancient rome IT referred to all free men or in other words all free human beings ad hominem can be a way to use reputation rumors and hearsay to change the minds of other people listening when a social network has already excluded or exiled one perso or applied a negative label to them this can work More often IT is most of the time considered to be a weak and poor argument in courts and in diplomacy ad hominems are not appreciated ad hominems are not wrong every time for example when people think that someone cant be trusted things that they have said previously can be doubted what an ad hominem argument looks like in logic a proof is something that starts with premises and goes through a few logical arguments to reach a conclusion normal valid proof all humans are mortal socrates is human therefore socrates is mortal ad hominem example perso a thinks abortion should be illegal perso a is uneducated and poor therefore abortion should not be illegal in this example IT can be seen that the completely unrelated fact that perso a is uneducated and poor is used to prove that abortion should not be illegal related pages fallacy for a list of other types of false rhetorical arguments Lati words used in english native americans also called aboriginal americans american indians amerindians or indigenous peoples of the americas are the people and their descendants WHO were in the americas when europeans arrived sometimes these people are called indians but this may be confusing because IT is the same word used for people from india when Christopher columbus explored he did not know about the americas he was in the caribbean but thought he was in the east indies so he called the people indians there are many different tribes of native american people with many different languages some tribes were huntergatherers WHO moved from place to place others lived in one place and built cities and kingdoms many native americans died after the europeans came to the americas there were diseases that came with the europeans but were new to the native americans there were battles with the europeans many native people were hurt killed or forced to leave their homes by settlers WHO took their lands today there are More than three million native americans in canada and the us combined about million More native americans live in Lati america many native americans still speak native languages and have their own cultural practices while others have adopted some parts of western culture many native americans face problems with discrimination and racism origins the ancestors of native americans came to the americas from asia some of them may have come to america years ago when Alaska was connected to siberia by the Bering land bridge the earliest people in the americas came from siberia when there was an ice bridge across the Bering strait the cold but mainly grassy plain which connected siberia with canada is called beringia IT is reckoned that a few thousand people arrived in beringia from eastern siberia during the last glacial maximum before moving into the americas sometime after years before the present bp this would have occurred as the american glaciers blocking the way southward melted but before the bridge was covered by the sea about years bp before european colonization beringia was inhabited by the yupik peoples olla both sides of the straits this culture remains in the region today with others in the governments of russia and the united states announced a plan to formally establish a transboundary area of shared beringian heritage among other things this agreement would establish close ties between the Bering land bridge national preserve and the cape krusenstern national monument in the united states and beringia national park in russia native americans are divided into many small nations called first nations in canada and tribes elsewhere culture each native american tribe has their own culture the cultures can be grouped together depending olla region for example the tribes living in mesoamerica have similar cultures food native americans Ate many different things depending olla where they lived native americans from mesoamerica introduced vanilla avocados and chocolate to the world religion before europeans came the native peoples of the americans practiced many different religions each tribe had their own different beliefs today many native americans practice christianity a religion that was brought to the americas by europeans meanwhile others still practice their own religions languages native americans today speak over a thousand different languages some of these languages had writing systems before europeans came many of these languages are endangered because More people are speaking european languages and not teaching native american languages to their kids music native americans make musical instruments using the things around them Art native americans make a lot of different Art today north america united states according to the united states census of americans say they are native american million people and of americans say they are both native american and something

Guatemala are poor many of them have left the country to find better jobs elsewhere south america Bolivia the majority of bolivians belong to indigenous groups Peru Peru has a large indigenous population around of perus population identify as indigenous or mestizo indigenous activism in the later half of the th century many native americans started to protest the unfair treatment they experienced from the societies they lived in some native americans have become famous in politics for example an aymara man named evo morales was elected as president of Bolivia in he was the first indigenous presidential candidate in Bolivia and south america related pages first nations plains indians native americans in the united states references Apple is the edible fruit of a number of trees known for this juicy Green or red fruits the tree malus spp is grown worldwide its fruit is lowcost and popular and is harvested all over the world applewood is a type of wood that comes from this tree the Apple tree comes from southern kazakhstan kyrgyzstan Uzbekistan and northwestern part of china apples have been grown for thousands of years in asia and europe they were brought to north america by european settlers apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures apples are generally propagated by grafting although wild apples grow readily from seed Apple trees are large if grown from seed but small if grafted onto roots rootstock there are More than known cultivars of apples with a range of desired characteristics different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses cooking eating raw and cider production are the most common uses trees and fruit are attacked by fungi bacteria and pests in the fruits genome was sequenced as part of research olla disease control and selective breeding in Apple production worldwide production of apples in was million tonnes china grew of the total botanical information the Apple has a small leafshedding tree that grows up to tall the Apple tree has a broad crown with thick twigs the leaves are alternately arranged simple ovals they are to centimetres long and centimetres in wide IT has a sharp top with a soft underside blossoms come out in spring at the same time that the leaves begin to bud the flowers are white they also have a slightly pink color they are five petaled and to centimetres to in in diameter the fruit matures in autumn IT is usually to centimetres to in in diameter there are five carpels arranged in a star in the middle of the fruit every carpel has one to three seeds wild ancestors the wild ancestor of Apple trees is malus sieversii they grow wild in the mountains of central asia in the north of kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan and xinjiang china and possibly also malus sylvestris unlike domesticated apples their leaves become red in autumn they are being used recently to develop malus domestica to grow in colder climates history the Apple tree was possibly the earliest tree to be cultivated its fruits have become better over thousands of years IT is said that Alexander the great discovered dwarf apples in asia minor in bc asia and europe have used winter apples as an important food for thousands of years from when europeans arrived argentina and the united states have used apples as food as well apples were brought to north america in the s the first Apple orchard olla the north american continent was said to be near Boston in in the s costly fruit industries where the Apple was a very important species began developing in culture paganism in norse mythology the goddess iðunn gives apples to the gods in prose edda written in the th century by snorri sturluson that makes them young forever english scholar h r ellis davidson suggests that apples were related to religious practices in germanic paganism IT was from there she claims that norse paganism developed she points out that buckets of apples were discovered in the place of burial for the oseberg ship in norway she also remarks that fruit and nuts iðunn having been described as changing into a nut in skáldskaparmál have been discovered in the early graves of the germanic peoples in england they have also been discovered somewhere Else olla the continent of europe she suggests that this may have had a symbolic meaning nuts are still a symbol of fertility in southwest england cooking sometimes apples are eaten after they are cooked often apples are eaten uncooked apples can also be made into drinks Apple Juice and Apple cider are Apple drinks the flesh of the fruit is firm with a taste anywhere from sour to sweet apples used for cooking are sour and need to be cooked with sugar while other apples are sweet and do not need cooking there are some seeds at the Core that can be removed with a tool that removes the Core or by carefully using a knife the scientific name of the Apple tree genus in the Lati language is malus most apples that people grow are of the malus domestica species most apples are good to eat raw not cooked and are also used in many kinds of baked foods such as Apple pie apples are cooked until they are soft to make Apple sauce apples are also made into the drinks Apple Juice and cider usually cider contains a little alcohol about as much as beer the regions of brittany in france and Cornwall in england are known for their Apple ciders Apple cultivars if one wants to grow a certain type of Apple IT is not possible to do this by planting a seed from the wanted type the seed Will have DNA from the Apple that the seeds came from but IT Will also have DNA from the Apple flower that pollinated the seeds which may well be a different type this means that the tree which would grow from planting would be a mixture of two in order to grow a certain type of Apple a small twig or scion is cut from the tree that grows the type of Apple desired and then added olla to a specially grown stump called a rootstock the tree that grows Will only create apples of the type needed there are More than known cultivars varieties of apples different cultivars are available for temperate and subtropical climates one large collection of over Apple cultivars is at the national fruit collection in england most of these cultivars are grown for eating fresh dessert apples however some are grown simply for cooking or making cider cider apples are usually too tart to eat immediately however they give cider a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot most popular Apple cultivars are soft but crisp colorful skin easy shipping disease resistance red delicious Apple shape and popular flavor are also needed modern apples are usually sweeter than older cultivars this is because popular tastes in apples have become different most north americans and europeans enjoy sweet apples extremely sweet apples with hardly any acid taste are popular in asia and india in the united kingdom in the united kingdom there are about different types of apples the most common Apple type grown in england is the bramley seedling which is a popular cooking Apple Apple orchards are not as common as they were in the early s when apples were rarely brought in from other countries organizations such as common ground teach people about the importance of rare and local varieties of fruit in north america many apples are grown in temperate parts of the united

included as abrahamic religions are samaritanism druze rastafari babism and baháí faith mandaeism a religion that holds many abrahamic beliefs is not called abrahamic because its followers think Abraham was a false prophet true abrahamic religions are monotheistic the belief that there is only one god they also all believe that people should pray to god and worship god often among monotheistic religions the abrahamic religions have the worlds largest number of followers they are also all ethical monotheistic religions this means they have rules that they have to follow religions algebra from arabic الجبر transliterated aljabr meaning reunion of broken parts is a part of mathematics IT uses variables to represent a value that is not yet known when an equals sign is used this is called an equation a very simple equation using a variable is in this example or IT could also be said that equals five this is called solving for besides equations there are inequalities less than and greater than a special type of equation is called the function this is often used in making graphs because IT always turns one input into one output algebra can be used to solve real problems because the rules of algebra work in real life and numbers can be used to represent the values of real things physics engineering and computer programming are areas that use algebra all the time IT is also useful to know in surveying construction and business especially accounting people WHO do algebra use the rules of numbers and mathematical operations used olla numbers the simplest are adding subtracting multiplying and dividing More advanced operations involve exponents starting with squares and square roots algebra was first used to solve equations and inequalities two examples are linear equations the equation of a straight line or and quadratic equations which has variables that are squared multiplied by itself for example or history early forms of algebra were developed by the babylonians and the greek geometers such as hero of alexandria however the word algebra is a Lati form of the arabic word aljabr casting and comes from a mathematics book almaqala fi hisabal jabr waalmuqabilah essay olla the computation of casting and equation written in the th century by a Persia mathematician Muhammad ibn mūsā alkhwārizmī WHO was a muslim born in khwarizm in Uzbekistan he flourished under almamoun in baghdad iraq through ad and died around ad the book was brought into europe and translated into Lati in the th century the book was then given the name algebra the ending of the mathematicians name alkhwarizmi was changed into a word easier to say in Lati and became the english word algorithm examples here is a simple example of an algebra problem Sue has candies and ann has candies they decide to share so that they have the same number of candies how many candies Will each have these are the steps you can use to solve the problem to have the same number of candies ann has to give some to Sue let represent the number of candies ann gives to Sue sues candies plus must be the same as anns candies minus this is written as subtract from both sides of the equation this gives what happens olla one side of the equal sign must happen olla the other side too for the equation to still be true so in this case when was subtracted from both sides there was a middle step of after a perso is comfortable with this the middle step is not written down ADD to both sides of the equation this gives divide both sides of the equation by this gives the answer is six this mean that if ann gives Sue candies they Will have the same number of candies to check this put back into the original equation wherever was this gives which is true they each now have candies with practice algebra can be used when faced with a problem that is too hard to solve any other way problems such as building a freeway designing a cell phone or finding the cure for a disease all require algebra writing algebra as in most parts of mathematics adding to or plus is written as subtracting from or minus is written as and dividing by or over is written as or in algebra multiplying by or times can be written in different ways or just all of these notations mean the same thing times the symbol used in arithmetic is not used in algebra because IT looks too much like the letter which is often used as a variable when we multiply a number and a variable in algebra we can simply write the number in front of the letter when the number is then IT is not written because times any number is that number and so IT is not needed and when IT is we can completely remove the terms because times any number is zero as a side note you do not have to use the letters or in algebra variables are just symbols that mean some unknown number or value so you can use any letter for a variable except eulers number and imaginary unit because these are mathematical constants and are the most common though functions and graphs an important part of algebra is the study of functions since they often appear in equations that we are trying to solve a function is like a machine you can put a number or numbers into and get a certain number or numbers out when using functions graphs can be powerful tools in helping us to study the solutions to equations a graph is a picture that shows all the values of the variables that make the equation or inequality true usually this is easy to make when there are only one or two variables the graph is often a line and if the line does not bend or go straight upanddown IT can be described by the Basic formula the variable is the yintercept of the graph where the line crosses the vertical axis and is the slope or steepness of the line this formula applies to the coordinates of a graph where each point olla the line is written in some math problems like the equation for a line there can be More than one variable and in this case to find points olla the line one variable is changed the variable that is changed is called the independent variable then the math is done to make a number the number that is made is called the dependent variable most of the time the independent variable is written as and the dependent variable is written as for example in this is often put olla a graph using an axis going left and right and a axis going up and down IT can also be written in function form so in this example we could put in for and get put in for would get and for would get so there would be a line going through the points and as seen in the graph to the right if has a power of IT is a straight line if IT is squared or some other power IT Will be curved if IT uses an inequality or then usually part of the graph is shaded either above or below the line rules in algebra there are a few rules that can be used for further understanding of equations these are called the rules of algebra while these rules may seem senseless or obvious IT is wise to understand that these properties do not hold throughout all branches of mathematics therefore IT Will be useful to know how these axiomatic rules are declared before taking them for granted before going olla to the rules reflect olla two definitions that Will be given opposite the opposite of is reciprocal the reciprocal of is commutative property of addition commutative means that a function has the same result if the numbers are swapped around in other words the order of the terms in an equation does not matter when two terms addends are being added the commutative property of addition is applicable in algebraic terms this gives note that this does not apply for subtraction ie except if commutative property of multiplication when two terms factors are being multiplied the commutative property of multiplication is applicable in algebraic terms this gives note that this does not apply for division ie when and except if associative property of addition associative refers to the grouping of numbers the associative property of addition implies that when adding three or More terms IT doesnt matter how these terms are grouped algebraically this gives note that this does not hold for subtraction eg see distributive property associative property of multiplication the associative property of multiplication implies that when multiplying three or More terms IT doesnt matter how these terms are grouped algebraically this gives note that this does not hold for division eg distributive property the distributive property states that the multiplication of a term by another term can be distributed for instance do not confuse this with the associative properties for instance additive identity identity refers to the property of a number that IT is equal to itself in other words there exists an operation of two numbers so that IT equals the variable of the sum the additive identity property states that any number plus is that number this also holds for subtraction multiplicative identity the multiplicative identity property states that any number times is that number this also holds for division additive inverse property the additive inverse property is somewhat like the opposite of the additive identity when we ADD a number and its opposite the result is algebraically IT states the following which is the same as for example the additive inverse or opposite of is multiplicative inverse property the multiplicative inverse property means that when we multiply a number and its inverse the result is algebraically IT states the following which is the same as for example the multiplicative inverse or just inverse of is to get the inverse of a fraction switch the numerator and the denominator the inverse of is advanced algebra in addition to elementary algebra or Basic algebra there are advanced forms of algebra taught in colleges and universities such as abstract algebra linear algebra and universal algebra this includes how to use a matrix to solve many linear equations at once abstract algebra is the study of things that are found in equations going beyond numbers to the More abstract with groups of numbers many math problems are about physics and engineering in many of these physics problems time is a variable the letter used for time is using the Basic ideas in algebra can help reduce a math problem to its simplest form making IT easier to solve difficult problems energy is force is mass is acceleration is and speed of light is sometimes this is used in some famous equations like and although More complex math beyond algebra was needed to come up with that last equation related pages list of mathematics topics order of operations parabola computer algebra system references other websites khan academy algebra theory and practice algebrarulescom a free place to learn the basics of algebra khan academy origins of algebra free online micro lectures fields of mathematics atoms are very small pieces of matter there are many different types of atoms each with its own name mass and size these different types of atoms are called chemical elements the chemical elements are organized olla the periodic table examples of elements are hydrogen carbon chlorine and gold etc atoms are very small but their exact size depends olla the element atoms range from to nanometers in width one nanometer is about times smaller than the width of a human hair this makes atoms impossible to see without special tools scientists discover how they work and interact with other atoms through experiments atoms can juoda together to make molecules for example two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom combine to make a water molecule and many separate molecules make up a glass of water when atoms juoda together IT is called a chemical reaction atoms can juoda together without forming separate molecules in this case every atom is connected to a giant web of atoms these are called crystals atoms are made up of three kinds of smaller particles called protons neutrons and electrons the protons and neutrons are heavier and stay in the middle of the atom which is called the nucleus the nucleus is surrounded by a cloud of lightweight electrons these are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force because they have opposite electric charges the number of protons an atom has defines what chemical element IT is this number is sometimes called its atomic number for example hydrogen has one proto and sulfur has protons because the mass of neutrons and protons is very similar and the mass of electrons is very small we can call the amount of protons and neutrons in an atom its atomic mass atoms move faster when they are in their gas form because they are free to move than they do in liquid form and solid matter in solid materials the atoms are tightly packed next to each other so they vibrate but are not able to move there is no room as atoms in liquids do history the word atom comes from the greek ἀτόμος atomos indivisible from ἀ not and τόμος a cut the first historical mention of the word atom came from works by the greek philosopher democritus around bc atomic theory stayed as a mostly philosophical subject with not much actual scientific investigation or study until the development of chemistry in the s in french chemist anto lavoisier defined the term element for the first time he said that an element was any Basic substance that could not be broken down into other substances by the methods of chemistry any substance that could be broken down was a compound in english philosopher John dalton suggested that elements were tiny solid balls made of atoms dalton believed that all atoms of the same element have the same mass he said that compounds are formed when atoms of More than one element combine according to dalton in a certain compound the atoms of the compounds elements always combine the same way in british scientist Robert brown looked at polle grains in water under his microscope the polle grains appeared to be jiggling brown used daltons atomic theory to describe patterns in the way they moved this was called brownian motion in Albert Einstein used mathematics to prove that the seemingly random movements were caused by the reactions of atoms and by doing this he conclusively proved the existence of the atom in russian scientist dmitri mendeleev published the first versio of the periodic table the periodic table groups elements by their atomic number how many protons they have this is usually the same as the number of electrons elements in the same column or period usually have similar properties for example helium neon argon krypto and xenon are all in the same column and have very similar properties all these elements are gases that have no colour and no smell also they are unable to combine with other atoms to form compounds together they are known as the noble gases the physicist jj thomson was the first perso to discover electrons this happened while he was working with cathode rays in he realized they had a negative charge and the atomic nucleus had a positive charge thomson created the plum pudding model which stated that an atom was like plum pudding the dried fruit electrons were stuck in a mass of pudding nucleus in a scientist named Ernest Rutherford used the geigermarsden experiment to prove that most of an atom is in a very small space the atomic nucleus Rutherford took a photo plate and covered IT with gold foil and then shot alpha particles made of two protons and two neutrons stuck together at IT many of the particles went through the gold foil which proved that atoms are mostly empty space electrons are so small they make up only of an atoms mass in niels Bohr introduced the Bohr model this model showed that electrons travel around the nucleus in fixed circular orbits this was More accurate than the Rutherford model however IT was still not completely right improvements to the Bohr model have been made since IT was first introduced in chemist frederick soddy found that some elements in the periodic table had More than one kind of atom for example any atom with protons should be a helium atom usually a helium nucleus also contains two neutrons however some helium atoms have only one neutron this means they truly are helium because an element is defined by the number of protons but they are not normal helium either soddy called an atom like this with a different number of neutrons an isotope to get the name of the isotope we look at how many protons and neutrons IT has in its nucleus and ADD this to the name of the element so a helium atom with two protons and one neutron is called helium and a carbon atom with six protons and six neutrons is called carbon however when he developed his theory soddy could not be certain neutrons actually existed to prove they were real physicist James chadwick and a team of others created the mass spectrometer the mass spectrometer actually measures the mass and weight of individual atoms by doing this chadwick proved that to account for all the weight of the atom neutrons must exist in german chemist Otto hahn became the first perso to create nuclear fissio in a laboratory he discovered this by chance when he was shooting neutrons at a uranium atom hoping to create a new isotope however he noticed that instead of a new isotope the uranium simply changed into a barium atom a smaller atom than uranium apparently hahn had broken the uranium atom this was the worlds first recorded nuclear fissio reaction this discovery eventually LED to the creation of the atomic bomb further into the th century physicists went deeper into the mysteries of the atom using particle accelerators they discovered that protons and neutrons were actually made of other particles called quarks the most accurate model so far comes from the Schrödinger equation Schrödinger realized that the electrons exist in a cloud around the nucleus called the electron cloud in the electron cloud IT is impossible to know exactly where electrons are the Schrödinger equation is used to find out where an electron is likely to be this area is called the electrons orbital structure and parts parts the complex atom is made up of three Maa particles the proto the neutron and the electron the isotope of hydrogen hydrogen has no neutrons just the one proto and one electron protons have a positive electric charge and electrons have a negative charge a positive hydrogen ion has no electrons just the one proto these two examples are the only known exceptions to the rule that all other atoms have at least one proto one neutron and one electron each electrons are by far the smallest of the three atomic particles their mass and size is too small to be measured using current technology they have a negative charge protons and neutrons are of similar size and weight to each other protons are positively charged and neutrons have no charge most atoms have a neutral charge because the number of protons positive and electrons negative are the same the charges balance out to zero however in ions different number of electrons this is not always the case and they can have a positive or a negative charge protons and neutrons are made out of quarks of two types up quarks and down quarks a proto is made of two up quarks and one down quark and a neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark nucleus the nucleus is in the middle of an atom IT is made up of protons and neutrons usually in nature two things with the same charge repel or shoot away from each other so for a long time IT was a mystery to scientists how the positively charged protons in the nucleus stayed together they solved this by finding a particle called a gluon its name comes from the word glue as gluons act like atomic glue sticking the protons together using the strong nuclear force IT is this force which also holds the quarks together that make up the protons and neutrons the number of neutrons in relation to protons defines whether the nucleus is stable or goes through radioactive decay when there are too many neutrons or protons the atom tries to make the numbers the same by getting rid of the extra particles IT does this by emitting radiation in the form of alpha beta or gamma decay nuclei can change through other means too nuclear fissio is when the nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei releasing a lot of stored energy this release of energy is what makes nuclear fissio useful for making bombs and electricity in the form of nuclear power the other way nuclei can change is through nuclear fusion when two nuclei juoda together or fuse to make a heavier nucleus this process requires extreme amounts of energy in order to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the protons as they have the same charge such high energies are most common in stars like our sun which fuses hydrogen for fuel electrons electrons orbit or travel around the nucleus they are called the atoms electron cloud they are attracted towards the nucleus because of the electromagnetic force electrons have a negative charge and the nucleus always has a positive charge so they attract each other around the nucleus some electrons are further out than others in different layers these are called electron shells in most atoms the first Shell has two electrons and all after that have eight exceptions are rare but they do happen and are difficult to predict the further away the electron is from the nucleus the weaker the pull of the nucleus olla IT this is why bigger atoms with More electrons react More easily with other atoms the electromagnetism of the nucleus is not strong enough to hold onto their electrons and atoms lose electrons to the strong attraction of smaller atoms radioactive decay some elements and many isotopes have what is called an unstable nucleus this means the nucleus is either too big to hold itself together or has too many protons or neutrons when this happens the nucleus has to get rid of the excess mass or particles IT does this through radiation an atom that does this can be called radioactive unstable atoms continue to be radioactive until they lose enough massparticles that they become stable all atoms above atomic number protons lead are radioactive there are three Maa types of radioactive decay alpha beta and gamma alpha decay is when the atom shoots out a particle having two protons and two neutrons this is essentially a helium nucleus the result is an element with atomic number two less than before so for example if a beryllium atom atomic number went through alpha decay IT would become helium atomic number alpha decay happens when an atom is too big and needs to get rid of some mass beta decay is when a neutron turns into a proto or a proto turns into a neutron in the first case the atom shoots out an electron in the second case IT is a positron like an electron but with a positive charge the end result is an element with one higher or one lower atomic number than before beta decay happens when an atom has either too many protons or too many neutrons gamma decay is when an atom shoots out a gamma Ray or wave IT happens when there is a change in the energy of the nucleus this is usually after a nucleus has already gone through alpha or beta decay there is no change in the mass or atomic number or the atom only in the stored energy inside the nucleus every radioactive element or isotope has what is named a halflife this is how long IT takes half of any sample of atoms of that type to decay until they become a different stable isotope or element large atoms or isotopes with a big difference between the number of protons and neutrons Will therefore have a long half life because they must lose More neutrons to become stable Marie Curie discovered the first form of radiation she found the element and named IT radium she was also the first female recipient of the Nobel prize frederick soddy conducted an experiment to observe what happens as radium decays he placed a sample in a light bulb and waited for IT to decay suddenly helium containing protons and neutrons appeared in the bulb and from this experiment he discovered this type of radiation has a positive charge James chadwick discovered the neutron by observing decay products of different types of radioactive isotopes chadwick noticed that the atomic number of the elements was lower than the total atomic mass of the atom he concluded that electrons could not be the cause of the extra mass because they barely have mass enrico fermi used the neutrons to shoot them at uranium he discovered that uranium decayed a lot faster than usual and produced a lot of alpha and beta particles he also believed that uranium got changed into a new element he named hesperium Otto hahn and fritz strassmann repeated fermis experiment to see if the new element hesperium was actually created they discovered two new things fermi did not observe by using a lot of neutrons the nucleus of the atom would split producing a lot of heat energy also the fissio products of uranium were already discovered thorium palladium radium radon and lead fermi then noticed that the fissio of one uranium atom shot Off More neutrons which then split other atoms creating chain reactions he realised that this process is called nuclear fissio and could create huge amounts of heat energy that very discovery of fermis LED to the development of the first nuclear bomb codenamed trinity references other websites general information olla atomic structure atomic structure timeline atom science citizendium chemistry nuclear physics astronomy from the greek astron ἄστρον meaning star and nomos nόμος meaning law is the scientific study of celestial bodies the patterns in the night sky are called constellations the objects studied include stars galaxies planets moons asteroids comets and nebulae phenomena that are studied include supernovae explosions gamma Ray bursts and cosmic microwave background radiation astronomy concerns the development physics chemistry meteorology and movement of celestial bodies as well as the structure and development of the universe astronomy is one of the oldest sciences ancient greek people used the positions of the stars to navigate and to find when was the best time to plant crops astrophysics is an important part of astronomy a related subject cosmology is concerned with studying the universe as a whole and the way the universe changed over time astronomy is not the same as astrology the belief that motion of the stars and the planets may affect human lives since the th century there have been two Maa types of astronomy observational and theoretical astronomy observational astronomy uses telescopes and cameras to observe or look at stars galaxies and other astronomical objects theoretical astronomy uses maths and computer models to explain the observations and predict what might happen working together theories predict what should happen and observations show whether the predictions work the Maa work of astronomy is to explain puzzling features of the universe for many years the most important issue was the motions of planets now many other topics are studied history of astronomy ancient early astronomers used only their eyes to look at the stars they made maps of the constellations and stars for religious reasons and calendars to work out the time of year early civilisations such as the maya people and the ancient egyptians built simple observatories and drew maps of the stars positions they also began to think about the place of earth in the universe for a long time people thought earth was the center of the universe and that the planets the stars and the sun went around IT this is known as geocentrism ancient greeks tried to explain the motions of the sun and stars by taking measurements a mathematician named eratosthenes was the first WHO measured the size of the earth and proved that the earth is a sphere a theory by another mathematician named aristarchus was that the sun is in the center and the earth is moving around IT this is known as heliocentrism only a few people thought IT was right the rest continued to believe in the geocentric model most of the names of constellations and stars come from greeks of that time arabic astronomers made many advancements during the middle ages including improved star maps and ways to estimate the size of the earth they also learned from the ancients by translating greek books into arabic renaissance to modern era during the renaissance a priest named nicolaus copernicus thought from looking at the way the planets moved that the earth was not the center of everything based olla previous works he said that the earth was a planet and all the planets moved around the sun this brought back the old idea of heliocentrism a physicist called Galileo Galilei built his own telescopes and used them to look More closely at the stars and planets for the first time he agreed with copernicus the catholic church thought Galileo was wrong he spent the rest of his life under house arrest heliocentric ideas were soon improved by Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton WHO invented the theory of gravity after Galileo people made better telescopes and used them to see farther objects such as the planets Uranus and neptune they also saw how stars were similar to our sun but in a range of colours and sizes they also saw thousands of other faraway objects such as galaxies and nebulae modern era the th century after saw important changes in astronomy in the early s IT began to be accepted that the galaxy in which we live the milky way is not the only galaxy the existence of other galaxies was settled by Edwin Hubble WHO identified the Andromeda nebula as a different galaxy IT was also Hubble WHO proved that the universe was expanding there were many other galaxies at large distances and they are receding moving away from our galaxy that was completely unexpected in Karl jansky discovered radio emissio from outside the earth when trying to isolate a source of noise in radio communications marking the birth of radio astronomy and the first attempts at using another part of the electromagnetic spectrum to observe the sky those parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that the atmosphere did not block were now opened up to astronomy allowing More discoveries to be made the opening of this new window olla the universe saw the discovery of entirely new things for example pulsars which sent regular pulses of radio waves out into space the waves were first thought to be alien in origin because the pulses were so regular that IT implied an artificial source the period after world war saw More observatories where large and accurate telescopes are built and operated at good observing sites normally by governments for example bernard lovell began radio astronomy at jodrell bank using leftover military radar equipment by the site had the largest steerable radio telescope in the world similarly the end of the s saw the start of the building of dedicated observatories at mauna kea in hawaii a good site for visible and infrared telescopes thanks to its high altitude and clear skies the next great revolution in astronomy was thanks to the birth of rocketry this allowed telescopes to be placed in space olla satellites space telescopes gave access for the first time in history to the entire electromagnetic spectrum including rays that had been blocked by the atmosphere the xrays gamma rays ultraviolet light and parts of the infrared spectrum were all opened to astronomy as observing telescopes were launched as with other parts of the spectrum new discoveries were made from s satellites were launched to be replaced with More accurate and better satellites causing the sky to be mapped in nearly all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum discoveries discoveries broadly come in two types bodies and phenomena bodies are things in the universe whether IT is a planet like our earth or a galaxy like our milky way phenomena are events and happenings in the universe bodies for convenience this section has been divided by where these astronomical bodies may be found those found around stars are solar bodies those inside galaxies are galactic bodies and everything Else larger are cosmic bodies solar planets asteroids comets galactic stars diffuse objects nebulas clusters compact stars white dwarf stars neutron stars black holes cosmic galaxies galaxy clusters superclusters phenomena burst events are those where there is a sudden change in the heavens that disappears quickly these are called bursts because they are normally associated with large explosions producing a burst of energy they include supernovas novas periodic events are those that happen regularly in a repetitive way the name periodic comes from period which is the length of time required for a wave to complete one cycle periodic phenomena include pulsars variable stars noise phenomena Tend to relate to things that happened a long time ago the signal from these events bounce around the universe until IT seems to come from everywhere and varies little in intensity in this way IT resembles noise the background signal that pervades every instrument used for astronomy the most common example of noise is static seen olla analogue televisions the principal astronomical example is cosmic background radiation methods instruments telescopes are the Maa tool of observing they take all the light in a big area and put in into a small area this is like making your eyes very big and powerful astronomers use telescopes to look at things that are far away and dim telescopes make objects look bigger closer brighter spectrometers study the different wavelengths of light this shows what something is made of many telescopes are in satellites they are space observatories the earths atmosphere blocks some parts of the electromagnetic spectrum but special telescopes above the atmosphere can detect that radiation radio astronomy uses radio telescopes aperture synthesis combines smaller telescopes to create a phased array which works like a telescope as big as the distance between the smaller telescopes techniques there are way astronomers can get better pictures of the heavens light from a distant source reaches a sensor and gets measured normally by a human eye or a camera for very dim sources there may not be enough light particles coming from the source for IT to be seen one technique that astronomers have for making IT visible is using integration which is like longer exposures in photography integration astronomical sources do not move much only the rotation and movement of the earth causes them to move across the heavens as light particles reach the camera over time they hit the same place making IT brighter and More visible than the background until IT can be seen telescopes at most observatories and satellite instruments can normally track a source as IT moves across the heavens making the star appear still to the telescope and allowing longer exposures also images can be taken olla different nights so exposures span hours days or even months in the digital era digitised pictures of the sky can be added together by computer which overlays the images after correcting for movement adaptive optics adaptive optics means changing the shape of the mirror or lens while looking at something to see IT better data analysis data analysis is the process of getting More information out of an astronomical observation than by simply looking at IT the observation is first stored as data this data Will then have various techniques used to analyse IT Fourier analysis Fourier analysis in mathematics can show if an observation over a length of time is changing periodically changes like a wave if so IT can extract the frequencies and the type of wave pattern and find many things including new planets subfields of astronomy pulsars pulse regularly in radio waves these turned out to be similar to some but not all of a type of bright source in xrays called a lowmass xray binary IT turned out that all pulsars and some lmxbs are neutron stars and that the differences were due to the environment in which the neutron star was found those lmxbs that were not neutron stars turned out to be black holes this section attempts to provide an overview of the important fields of astronomy solar astronomy solar astronomy is the study of the sun the sun is the closest star to earth at around million miles away IT is the easiest to observe in detail observing the sun can help us understand how other stars work and are formed changes in the sun can affect the weather and climate olla earth a stream of charged particles called the solar wind is constantly sent Off from the sun the solar wind hitting the earths magnetic field causes the northern lights planetary astronomy planetary astronomy is the study of planets moons dwarf planets comets and asteroids as well as other small objects that orbit stars the planets of our own solar system have been studied in depth by many visiting spacecraft such as cassinihuygens saturn and the voyager and galactic astronomy galactic astronomy is the study of distant galaxies studying distant galaxies is the best way of learning about our own galaxy as the gases and stars in our own galaxy make IT difficult to observe galactic astronomers attempt to understand the structure of galaxies and how they are formed through the use of different types of telescopes and computer simulations gravitational wave astronomy gravitational wave astronomy is the study of the universe in the gravitational wave spectrum so far all astronomy that has been done has used the electromagnetic spectrum gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime emitted by very dense objects changing shape which include white dwarves neutron stars and black holes because no one has been able to detect gravitational waves directly the impact of dravitational wave astronomy has been limited related pages asteroid astrobiology black hole comet galaxy meteor

designing the structures of buildings IT uses both Art and engineering examples include houses churches hotels office buildings roads viaducts tunnels and Bridges architecture is the professio of an architect usually a perso must study at an institution of higher education university to become an architect there were architects long before there was higher education they learnt by being an apprentice to an established architect architecture can do small designs such as for a garage or large designs such as for a whole city the capital cities of brasília and Canberra were designed architecture often overlaps with structural engineering and architects and engineers often work together history in the past people built huts and wood houses to protect themselves from the weather for safety they were often close together great civilizations like the ancient egyptians built large temples and structures like the great pyramids of giza the ancient greeks and romans made what we now call classical architecture the romans working over years ago copied the arch from the etruscans WHO copied IT from the mesopotamians classical architecture was formal and IT always obeyed laws IT used symmetry which really means balance and IT used proportion between shapes the golden mean was a rule which said to put IT simply if you are making a room or any other thing IT Will work best if you always make the long side times as long as the short side there are many laws in classical architecture like how high the middle of an arched bridge needs to be which depends olla how wide the bridge needs to be these laws were learned from thousands of years of experience and they are often used today however today More notice is taken of specific facts such as what wind speeds occur once or twice in a century several Bridges have blown down because that was not properly taken into consideration in some parts of the world like india the architecture is famous for carving the stone olla temples and palaces different architectural styles occur in china japan southeast asia africa Mexico and central and south america architects in western europe in the middle ages made romanesque architecture then gothic architecture gothic buildings have tall pointed Windows and arches many churches have gothic architecture castles were also built at this time in eastern europe churches usually had domes people added their own ideas and decoration to the classical architecture of the past the renaissance brought a return to classical ideas in the late th century with the industrial revolution people began to invent machines to make things quickly and cheaply many factories and mills were built during or after this revolution decades later in the Victoria era architects like George fowler Jones and decimus burton still followed the gothic style to build new churches up to this point buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and masonry used to construct them gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with buttresses allowed stone buildings to be built taller for example the cathedral in ulm germany is over feet tall however building with stone has its limits and building too tall could result in collapse this happened to the beauvais cathedral which was never completed towards the end of the th century with a second industrial revolution steel became much cheaper architects began to use inventions like metal girders and reinforced concrete to build an example is the Eiffel tower in paris buildings can now be built taller than ever before we call them skyscrapers this new technology has made us free from traditional limitations and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated replaced or abandoned cheap strong glass soon brought transparent exterior walls especially for office buildings modernism is the name for the architectural style which developed because of these new building technologies and its beginnings can been seen as early as modernism can also refer to a specific group of architects and buildings from the early to late th century and so may not be the proper term to use for many building built since then which are sometimes called postmodern many of the worlds greatest structures were built by modernday architects such as Frank lloyd Wright sir hugh casson norman Foster i m pei Adrian Smith Edward durell stone Frank gehry fazlur khan gottfried

studying human anatomy they discovered the functions of many organs like the liver spleen kidneys heart etc and were the first to discover the structure and functions of the lymphatic system for long periods the dissection of deceased people was forbidden and correct ideas about human anatomy was a long time coming academic human anatomists are usually employed by universities medical schools and teaching hospitals they are often involved in teaching and research gross anatomy studies parts of the body that are big enough to see microanatomy studies smaller parts body systems there are

but smaller they range from very small smaller than a car to miles km across a few asteroids have asteroid moon the name asteroid means like a star in the ancient greek language asteroids may look like small stars in the sky but they really do move around the sun while stars only seem to move because the earth spins like planets asteroids do not make their own light because of this some people think asteroids is not a good name and think that the name planetoid like a planet would be a better name Giuseppe piazzi found the first asteroid in he called IT ceres and IT is the biggest object in the asteroid belt others like juno Pallas and vesta were found later in the s so many had been found that they were numbered by a minor planet designation starting with ceres today astronomers using computerized telescopes find thousands of asteroids every month asteroid impact prediction is one of the purposes asteroids are the leftover rock and other material from the formation of the solar system these rocks were too small to come together to make a planet some are made of carbon or metal depending olla whats olla the surface they are classified into various asteroid spectral types including type m metal type s stone and type c carbon most asteroids in our solar system are in the asteroid belt between mars and Jupiter many are not in the Maa asteroid belt the ones that come close to earth are called nearearth asteroids many scientists think asteroids striking the earth killed Off all the dinosaurs and caused some of the other extinction events afghanistan officially the islamic emirate of afghanistan pashtodari is a country in south asia IT borders Pakistan in the south and east Iran in the west Turkmenistan Uzbekistan and tajikistan in the north and china in the far northeast Kabul serves as the countrys capital city afghanistan is currently governed by the taliban after the collapse of the internationally recognized islamic republic of afghanistan olla August in early times people passed through IT with animals and other goods as IT connected china and india with central asia and the middle east More recently afghanistan has been damaged by many years of war this has resulted in there not being enough jobs the country is around in size there are million people in afghanistan there are about million afghan refugees people WHO had to leave the country WHO are in Pakistan and Iran for some time in its capital Kabul had about people living in IT united nations human rights council decided in october to appoint an independent expert or united nations special rapporteur olla afghanistan to find out about or probe violations carried out by the taliban and others WHO are now part of a big conflict media said geography afghanistan has many mountains the mountains are called the hindu kush and himalayas the tallest mountain in afghanistan is mount nowshak there are plains which have soil that is good for growing plants and foothills parts of the country are also dry especially the registan desert afghanistan has snow and glaciers in the mountains amu darya is the big water stream or river the country has an abundance of a valuable stone called lapis lazuli which was also used to decorate the tomb of the egyptian pharaoh tutankhamun climate afghanistan has a continental climate with hot summers and cold winters having no water sometimes causes problems for farmers sandstorms happen a lot in the desert plants and animals southern afghanistan has not many plants because IT is dry there are More plants where there is More water mountains have forests of pine and fir cedar oak walnut alder and ash trees afghanistans wild animals live in the mountains there are wolves foxes jackals bears and wild goats gazelles wild dogs camels and wild cats such as the snow leopard in the country the birds are falcons eagles and vultures the rhesus macaque and the red flying squirrel are also in afghanistan many years of war hunting and years of no water have killed animals in afghanistan there used to be tigers in afghanistan but now there arent any bears and wolves are almost gone people and culture many people have moved through or invaded the land of afghanistan todays people of afghanistan are known as afghans they have many traits passed down from these previous peoples the largest group of people are the pashtuns these make up about half the population tajiks are the secondlargest ethnic group making up about onefifth of the population before the th century tajiks were called sarts and some come from the iranian peoples most pashtuns are also related to the iranian peoples some pashtuns and tajiks marry each other but at the same time they are rivals the thirdlargest group are the hazaras they are native to the hazaristan area in central afghanistan the countrys other groups include the uzbek aimaq turkmen nuristani baloch pashayi and a few others daripersian and pashto are the official languages of afghanistan many people speak both languages both are indoeuropean languages from the iranian languages subfamily they are usually written with the arabic alphabet uzbek and turkmen are widely spoken in the north and nuristani and pashai are spoken in the east around of all afghans follow the religion of islam afghanistan is a largely rural country this means there are only a few Major cities about one fifth of the population live in cities Kabul the capital is the largest city IT is south of the hindu kush range and alongside the Kabul river other cities in afghanistan include kandahar hera mazare sharif and jalalabad the rural population is made up of farmers and nomads the farmers live mainly in small villages along the rivers the nomads live in tents while moving from place to place with their animals and belongings some people live in the high central mountains some live in the deserts in the south and southwest millions of people left afghanistan to get away from the wars that happened in the late th and early st centuries most of them lived in neighboring Pakistan and Iran history afghanistan is in the path of important trade routes that connect southern and eastern asia to europe and the middle east because of this many empire builders have decided to rule over the area signs that these emperors were near afghanistan still exist in many parts of the country afghanistan is near what used to be the silk road so IT has many cultures from up to years ago the peoples of afghanistan helped develop create Major world religions traded and exchanged many products and sometimes controlled politics and culture in asia prehistory archaeologists digging a cave in what is now northeastern afghanistan in badakhshan discovered that people lived in the country as early as years ago they found the skull of a neanderthal or early human as well as tools from about years ago in other parts of afghanistan archaeologists uncovered pottery and tools that are to years oldevidence that afghans were among the first people in the world to grow crops and raise animals farmers and herders settled in the plains surrounding the hindu kush as early as bc these people may have grown rich Off the lapis lazuli they found along riverbeds which they traded to early city sites to the west across the iranian plateau and Mesopotamia as farms and villages grew and thrived in afghanistan these ancient people eventually invented irrigation digging ditches for water so IT flows to crops that allowed them to grow crops olla the northern afghanistan desert plains this civilization advanced state of organization is today called bmac bactriamargiana archaeological complex or the oxus civilization the oxus civilization expanded as far east as western edge of the indus valley during the period between and bc these people WHO were the ancestors of the indoaryans used the term aryan to identify their ethnicity culture and religion scholars know this when they read the ancient texts of these people the avesta of iranic peoples and the vedas of indoaryans zoroaster the founder of the zoroastrian religion the worlds earliest monotheistic religion meaning a religion believing in one god lived in the area somewhere north of todays afghanistan around bc ancient history before the middle of the sixth century bce afghanistan was held by the medes then the achaemenids took over control of the land and made IT part of the Persia empire Alexander the great defeated and conquered the Persia empire in bce he founded some cities in the area the people used macedonian culture and language after Alexander grecobactrians scythians kushans parthians and sassanians ruled the area kushans spread buddhism from india in the st century bce and buddhism remained an important religion in the area until the islamic conquest in the th century ce the buddhas of bamiyan were giant statues a reminder of buddhism in afghanistan they were destroyed by the taliban in there were international protests the taliban believe that the ancient statues were unislamic and that they had a right to destroy them medieval history arabs introduced islam in the th century and slowly began spreading the new religion in the th and th centuries many local islamic dynasties Rose to power inside afghanistan one of the earliest was the tahirids whose kingdom included balkh and hera they established independence from the abbasids in the tahirids were succeeded in about by the saffarids of zaranj in western afghanistan local princes in the north soon became feudatories of the powerful samanids WHO ruled from bukhara from to north of the hindu kush in afghanistan enjoyed a golden age under samanid rule in the th century the local ghaznavids turned ghazni into their capital and firmly established islam throughout all areas of afghanistan except the kafiristan region in the northeast mahmud of ghazni a great ghaznavid sultan conquered the multan and punjab region and carried raids into the heart of india Mohammed bin abdul jabbar utbi alutbi a historia from the th century wrote that thousands of afghans were in the ghaznavid army the ghaznavid dynasty was replaced by the ghorids of ghor in the late th century WHO reconquered ghaznavid territory in the name of islam and ruled IT until the ghorid army also included ethnic afghans afghanistan was recognized as khorasan meaning land of the rising sun which was a prosperous and independent geographic region reaching as far as the indus river all the Major cities of modern afghanistan were centers of science and culture in the past the new Persia literature arose and flourished in the area the early Persia poets such as rudaki were from what is now afghanistan moreover ferdowsi the author of shahnameh the national epic of Iran and rumi the famous sufi Poe were also from modernday afghanistan IT has produced scientists such as avicenna alfarabi albiruni omar khayyám alkhwarizmi and many others WHO are widely known for their important contributions in areas such as mathematics astronomy medicine physics geography and geology IT remained the cultural capital of Persia until the devastating mongol invasion in the th century timur the turkic conqueror took over in the end of the th century and began to rebuild cities in this region timurs successors the timurids were great patrons of learning and the arts WHO enriched their capital city of hera with fine buildings under their rule afghanistan enjoyed peace and prosperity between south of the hindu kush and the indus river todays Pakistan was the native land of the afghan tribes they called this land afghanistan meaning land of the afghans the afghans ruled the rich northern indian subcontinent with their capital at Delhi from the th to the early th century afghanistan was disputed between the safavids of isfahan and the mughals of Agra WHO had replaced the lodi and surra afghan rulers in india the safavids and mughals occasionally oppressed the native afghans but at the same time the afghans used each empire to punish the other in the hotaki afghans Rose to power and completely defeated the Persia empire then they marched towards the mughals of india and nominally defeated them with the help of the afsharid forces under nader shah afshar in after nader shah of Persia was killed a great leader named ahmad shah durra united all the different muslim tribes and established the afghan empire durra empire he is considered the founding father of the modern state of afghanistan while mirwais hotak is the grandfather of the nation since the s during the s afghanistan became a buffer zone between two powerful empires the british indian empire and the russian empire as british india advanced into afghanistan russia felt threatened and expanded southward across central asia to stop the russian advance Brita tried to make afghanistan part of its empire but the afghans fought wars with britishled indians from to and from to after the third war in afghanistan under King amanullah gained respect and recognition as a completely independent state the kingdom of afghanistan was a constitutional monarchy established in IT was the successor state to the emirate of afghanistan olla september during the reign of zahir shah the kingdom of afghanistan joined the league of nations during world war ii afghanistan remained neutral IT pursued a diplomatic policy of nonalignment the creation of Pakistan in as its eastern neighbor created problems in political crises LED to the overthrow of the King the countrys new leader ended the monarchy and made afghanistan a republic in a communist political party supported by the soviet union seized control of afghanistans government this move sparked rebellions throughout the country the government asked the soviet union for military assistance the soviets took advantage of the situation and invaded afghanistan in december most people in afghanistan opposed the sudden soviet presence in their country for nearly a decade anticommunist islamic forces known as mujahideen were trained inside neighboring Pakistan to fight the soviets and the afghan government the united states and other antisoviet countries supported the mujahideen in the long war over one million afghan civilians were killed the soviet army also Lost More than soldiers in that war millions of afghans left their country to stay safe in neighboring Pakistan and Iran in the soviet army withdrew the last of its troops after the soviets left in the afghan civil war started different afghan warlords began fighting for control of the country the warlords received support from other countries including neighboring Pakistan and Iran a very conservative islamic group known as the taliban emerged in an attempt to end the civil war by the late s the taliban had gained control over of afghanistan a group known as the northern alliance based in northern afghanistan near the border with tajikistan continued to fight against the taliban the taliban ruled afghanistan according to their strict versio of islamic law people whom the taliban believed violated these laws were given cruel punishments in addition the taliban completely restricted the rights of women because of such policies most countries refused to recognize the taliban government only Pakistan saudi Arabia and the united arab emirates uae accepted them as the official government the taliban also angered other countries by allowing suspected terrorists to live freely in afghanistan among them were Osama bin Laden and members of the alqaeda terrorist network in september the united states blamed bin Laden for the terrorist attacks olla the world trade center in new York city and the pentagon outside Washington dc the taliban refused to hand him over to the united states in response the united states and its allies launched a bombing campaign against alqaeda in october within months the taliban abandoned Kabul and a new government LED by hamid karzai came to power but fighting between the taliban and usled armies continued taliban fighters have gone into afghanistan from neighboring Pakistan afghans accuse pakistans military of being behind the taliban militants but Pakistan has rejected this and stated that a stable afghanistan is in pakistans own interest in december hamid karzai became the first democratically elected president of afghanistan Nato began rebuilding afghanistan including its military and government institutions many schools and colleges were built freedom for women has improved women can study work drive and run for office many afghan women work as politicians some are ministers while at least one is a mayor others have opened businesses or joined the military or police afghanistans economy has also improved dramatically and Nato agreed in to help the country for at least another years after in the meantime afghanistan improved diplomatic ties with many countries in the world and continues in August the cabinet of afghanistan Lost its power most of the country fell to the taliban olla August with
